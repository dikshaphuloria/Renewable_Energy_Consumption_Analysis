# Renewable Energy Consumption Analysis

## Project summary

> In the face of growing environmental concerns and the depletion of fossil fuel reserves, the transition to renewable energy sources has become a global imperative. Renewable energy derived from natural processes that are continuously replenished such as solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal offers a sustainable and cleaner alternative to traditional energy systems.

> This project focuses on analyzing renewable energy consumption trends across various countries from 2000 to 2022. By examining patterns linked to economic development, technological adoption, and energy sector investments, the study aims to uncover key drivers of renewable energy use. The project also forecasts energy consumption for the years 2023 and 2024 and evaluates progress toward global sustainability goals.
