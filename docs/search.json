    "text": "VISUALIZATION\n\nRenewable Energy Consumption Growth\n\nIn this section, we analyze the consumption trends of key renewable energy sources — biofuels, solar, wind, and hydro — over time. The visualization clearly illustrates a significant surge in the adoption of most renewable energy sources beginning around 2015. This upward trend highlights a pivotal shift in global energy strategies, as countries increasingly prioritized cleaner and more sustainable alternatives in response to climate change concerns, policy changes, and technological advancements.\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nRenewable Energy Consumption World Map\n\nA choropleth map was generated to analyze the temporal progress of renewable energy consumption across various countries. While North America initially held the largest share, the map reveals China’s increasing dominance, eventually becoming the global leader in renewable energy consumption.\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nNon-Renewable Energy Consumption Plots Analysis\n\nFollowing this, comparable plots were created to examine the trends in non-renewable energy consumption across the years. Though there is a noticable dip in the non-renewable energy resource consumption in 2020, the overall analysis indicates a relatively steady increase in non-renewable energy consumption.\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nEnergy Consumption Comparision Over Time\n\nThis analysis examines global energy consumption trends over the years, focusing on the top five consuming nations. While the United States led in 2000, China surpassed it by 2011 and maintained its dominant position through 2022. Notably, renewable energy consumption has increased, especially in China. However, non-renewable sources still remains the dominant energy resource for all countries, highlighting both the advancement of clean energy and the persistent dependence on fossil fuels in major economies."

Therefore, we cannot definitively confirm the observed dip in energy consumption during these later years."
